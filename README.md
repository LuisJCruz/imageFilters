This project created for class had in mind these objectives:
1. Apply the concepts of repetition (loops) and lists to a common SW application
2. Understand the design, implementation, and use of loop structures 
3. Gain experience implementing applications using layers of increasing complexity.
Using python we created four different image filters.
1) Negative Filter - The negative filter takes each value in the image and changes it for its INVERSE.
2) Image Flip - Each row of pixels is swapped with a corresponding row from the other end of the image.
3) Blurr Filter - This is a common filter used for smoothing out noisy images (images with a lot of random variation or low quality). 
4) Tiles Filter - It creates a 2x2 tiled image based off of the input image. The tile filter will look very close to having 4 copies of the original image but each of the 4 tiles will be slightly different. Each tile is half the width and half the height of the original image.
